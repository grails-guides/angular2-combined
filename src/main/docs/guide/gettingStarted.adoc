In this guide, you are going to create a combined build of the `server` and
`client` projects from the Angular profile. By default, the Angular profile sets up
separate frontend and backend apps, which can make for a more efficient development process.
However, this may not fit your deployment needs, particularly if your entire app is
being deployed to a servlet container such as Tomcat, or being executed as a "fat" JAR.
Thanks to the flexibility of Grails and the Gradle build tool, we can configure a
unified build of our Grails/Angular app with only a few changes.
