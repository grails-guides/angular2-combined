Our final change needs to happen in `UrlMappings.groovy`. If you recall, by default the `server` Grails app renders some
 application metadata at the root context. However, in order for our combined build to work, we need to load our Angular app
 at the root context. Fortunately, this is a very simple change as well.

Edit `server/grails-app/controllers/demo/UrlMappings.groovy`:

Delete this line:

[source,groovy]
----
'/'(controller: 'application', action:'index')
----

Replace it with this:

[source,groovy]
.server/grails-app/controllers/example/grails/UrlMappings.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/grails-app/controllers/example/grails/UrlMappings.groovy[indent=0, tag=defaultPage]
----
<1> We are using the `grails.util.Environment` class to determine whether we are running in development mode or in a deployed artefact,
and setting the URL mappings appropriately.

With this new mapping config, when we build our executable JAR file, the `/` URL will be mapped to `/index.html`,
which happens to also be the landing page for our AngularS application.
