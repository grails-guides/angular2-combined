The initial folder contains a Grails application generated with the `angular` profile. The project is a https://guides.gradle.org/creating-multi-project-builds/[Gradle Multiproject build].

Create a `build.gradle` file in the root project, at the same level as `settings.gradle`. Add the following content:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[indent=0]

<1> The `copyClientResources` task will copy the static files generated by `yarn build` into the resources directory of the `server` project.
<2> The `assembleServerAndClient` task ties the copy step to the existing Gradle `assemble` task for the `server` project. This means that we will get our unified archive only when running this top-level task (running `server:assemble`) alone will generate a "plain" WAR/JAR file without the client resources.
<3> If `copyClientResources` is to be executed, it must be before `:sever:assemble`. This ensures client static files will be available when the Grails app is assembled.
<4> After the combined JAR file has been created, we copy the files to the top-level `build` directory.

In this guide, we will be using an executable JAR file as our deployment target.
To enable this open the `server` project's `build.gradle` file, and *delete* the following line:

[source,groovy]
.server/build.gradle
----
apply plugin:"war"
----

TIP: Leave the `apply plugin: "war"` line in `server/build.gradle` if you wish to generate a WAR file.
